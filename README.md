# kinetic-clock-bubbles

* Project is live at:
https://fullstack-storyteller.github.io/kinetic-clock-bubbles/index.html

## Note:
Let the project run for sometime to see its full capability.

## Refreshing the webpage will reinitialize the clock with system time.

## This was sort of a passion project.
* I wanted to build a clock, then I thought why not build something kinetic.
* The synchronization of hour, minutes and seconds bubble was a bit tricky, but i got it to work. Key aspect was to understand the animation delay property of html tag involved in rotation on the clock frame.
* Pheww, what a ride....

## To ensure automatically rebuild projects hoisted with github page, we can push asn empty commit as below:
git commit -m 'rebuild pages' --allow-empty
git push origin <branch-name>
